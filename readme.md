## Welcome to the DDrC Repository!

We published a preprint of the DDrC, this scientific paper can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.16.580252v1

The files and instructions for building your own Dynamic Dark Root Chamber for root phenotyping with an infrared camera are available in this repository:
- The build_instructions.pdf contains a detailed building instruction for the chamber
- rootbox.py is the main script controlling the imagetaking
- The '3D print' folder contains all the .stl files for 3D printing the parts (LED_diffusor.stl has to be printed with transparent filament!)
- A disk image file of Raspberry Pi OS with all the necessary configurations made for running the DDrC can be downloaded here: https://drive.boku.ac.at/d/6b6a2837e5644a758b48/
